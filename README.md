# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer üïµÔ∏è

This project features a simple game of Cluedo where the user is presented with 3 cards: suspects, room and weapon. Upon only selecting all 3 cards, the mystery is revealed. The user will then not only dicover what this mystery is, but also - what the favourite weapon of select suspect is. 

When the user is done playing, they may click on the NEW ROUND button to refresh the page, clear the input, and play again.

The user may shuffle all 3 decks for as many times as they wish however, no mystery will be revealed until they have picked cards from all 3 decks.

## The problem üîç

This project is build using primarily JS, and by assigning, as well as calling functions in all of the decks. One particular problem or challenge was to make JS not display the mystery before all decks have been picked from. Another issue was displaying the suspect's favourite weapon. 

All in all, correct placement of certain functions plays a big role in this one!
